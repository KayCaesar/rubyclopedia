rubyclopedia
===========================

Rubyclopedia was shut down in August 2015.
It was an automatically populated catalogue of Ruby videos, tutorials and blog posts.

It was shut down because most of the sources were either no longer publishing content, or now have better ways of subscribing to their content.

Some of the sources of articles and videos included:
- Codecademy
- Codeschool
- Envylabs
- Pluralsight
- RailsCasts
- RubyTapas
- RubyRogues
