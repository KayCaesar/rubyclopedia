  %p The Rubyclopedia is brought to you from London by Camille Baldock.

  %p I created the Rubyclopedia to keep track of new Ruby learning materials available out there, as well as helping other Ruby developers in my teams find the right material for them

  %p I hope this can be of use to other Ruby developers out there :-)
